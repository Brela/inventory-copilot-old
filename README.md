# DSD_Team_C

Setup Instructions by Erik:
The server is currently running on localhost:4000 and deployed to a docker container. 
Once we have a domain I can set the docker container for public access. 
After merging this branch, make sure to install the following dependencies using npm install

npm i -D @types/node-fetch
npm i -D ts-node
npm i body-parser cors ioredis express
npm I -D @types/express
